                    Assassin's Creed is an action-adventure stealth video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and
                    published
                    by Ubisoft.
                    The plot is set in a fictional history of real world events and follows the centuries-old struggle
                    between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace
                    through
                    control.

                    ideas
                    and the growth of individuality. The Assassins, if not the Order itself, have existed since at least
                    456
                    BCE, throughout the Roman Empire, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Industrial Revolution and

                    the
                    Order is born of a realization. We require no creed. No indoctrination by desperate old men. All we
                    need
                    is that the world be as it is. And this is why the Templars will never be destroyed."

                <p class="bellefont">
                    Templars classically insist that human nature is too prone to corruption for this to be a
                    possibility.
                    Key to their dream is the imposition of a New World Order, and they envision that true peace can
                    only
                    come when all of humanity is shepherded by an enlightened society of people—in their eyes, them.

                    Altaïr, as experienced by protagonist Desmond Miles. The primary goal of the game is to carry out a

                    In 2012, bartender Desmond Miles is kidnapped by agents of Abstergo Industries, the world's largest
                    pharmaceutical conglomerate. Under the guidance of Dr. Warren Vidic and his assistant Lucy Stillman,
                    Desmond is forced to participate in a series of trials revolving around the "Animus", a machine
                    capable
                    of translating the genetic memories of his ancestors into a simulated reality. Vidic instructs him
                    to
                    relive the early years of Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, a senior member of the Assassin Brotherhood during the
                    time of the Third Crusade. His investigation reveals that Altaïr, blinded by arrogance, botched an
                    attempt by the Assassins to retrieve an artifact, the Ark of the Covenant, from the forces of Robert
                    de
                    Sablé, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, leading to the death of one Assassin, and severely
                    wounding
                    another in the process. Though Altaïr manages to partially redeem himself by fighting off a Crusader
                    attack on the Assassin home base of Masyaf, his mentor and superior, Al Mualim, orders him to
                    assassinate nine individuals in order to regain his honor.

                    Jade Raymond, producer of Assassin's Creed said "For Assassin's Creed we wanted the score to capture
                    the
                    gruesome atmosphere of medieval warfare but also be edgy and contemporary." The musical score was
                    composed by Jesper Kyd in 2007. Six tracks were made available online to those who have purchased
                    the
                    game; a password was given to people to insert at the soundtrack section of the Ubisoft website.[23]
                    Several tracks are also available to listen to on Kyd's MySpace and his official website. The
                    released
                    tracks as a whole have the archaic Latin chorus and dark orchestral music, while the track
                    "Meditation
                    Begins" features a kind of Saltarello with a very ominous, dark, ambient overtone with men
                    whispering in
                    Latin. The atmosphere in these tracks is what Jesper Kyd is known for and is effective in situ. The
                    soundtrack can be downloaded directly by clicking the music icon on the left.

                    Assassin's Creed is a 2016 American science fiction action adventure film based on the video game
                    franchise of the same name. The film is directed by Justin Kurzel, written by Michael Lesslie, Adam
                    Cooper and Bill Collage, and stars Michael Fassbender (who also produced), Marion Cotillard, Jeremy
                    Irons, Brendan Gleeson, Charlotte Rampling and Michael K. Williams. The film is set in the same
                    universe
                    as the video games but features an original story that expands the series' mythology, taking place
                    during the Spanish Inquisition. Filming began in late August 2015 and concluded in January 2016.
                    Assassin's Creed was released on December 21, 2016, in the United States and France. It received
                    negative reviews from critics[7] and grossed $240 million worldwide against its $125 million budget.
